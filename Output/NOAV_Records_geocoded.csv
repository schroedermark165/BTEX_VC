COGCC Staff had reason to believe Operator had committed one or more violations of COGCC Rules, and issued Warning Letter No. 401547726 to Operator on February 16, 2018, (""Warning Letter""), requiring Operator to conduct required MIT or plug and abandon delinquent wells by June 30, 2018 .

On August 27, 2018, Operator submitted an MIT Report (Document No. 401745644, ""Form 21"") documenting a failed MIT performed on July 20, 2018, on the Mabel Aylor (API No. 001-06628, ""Well""). The Well was included in the table of delinquent wells attached to the Warning Letter, and was subject to the June 30, 2018, corrective action due date.

On September 27, 2018 , COGCC Staff conducted an audit (“Audit”) of Operator's records for the Well. Through this Audit, COGCC Staff determined that Operator had not conducted MIT on the Well within the required timeframes in Rules 326.b.(1) and 326.c.(1) or by the corrective action deadline given by the Warning Letter COGCC Staff further determined that, as of September 27, 2018, Operator had not submitted any of the forms required prior to making repairs or P&A (e.g., Forms 6 or 42).

The Well failed the MIT performed on July 20, 2018, after the required timeframes, meaning Operator was required to make repairs or P&A the Well without an allowance of six months from the date of the unsuccessful test. Two months after the unsuccessful test, Operator had neither performed repairs/P&A, nor requested COGCC approval for plans to perform such actions, violating Rule 326.f.","In its Rule 522.d.(2) Answer, due within 28 days of the Operator’s receipt of the NOAV, Operator shall provide the following to COGCC:

COGCC Rules do not permit placing a well back on production to fulfill, or in lieu of, the requirements to conduct an MIT. 

COGCC Staff had reason to believe Operator had committed one or more violations of COGCC Rules, and issued Warning Letter No. 401591205 to Operator on March 29, 2018 , requiring Operator to conduct MIT or plug and abandon delinquent wells by June 30, 2018 .

On September 25, 2018 , COGCC Staff conducted an audit (“Audit”) of Operator's records for the well(s) in the attached table (""Well""). The Audit included reviewing records such as Operator's Form 7 Monthly Reports of Operations and Field Inspection Reports filed by COGCC Staff after inspecting the Well to determine the dates the Well was SI, and the COGCC database to determine whether Operator reported MIT(s) for the Well. Through this Audit, COGCC Staff determined that at least one Well in the attached table was overdue for performance of an MIT on a SI well.

Operator failed to conduct timely MIT(s) for at least one SI Well, violating Rule 326.b.","In its Rule 522.d.(2) Answer, due within 28 days of the Operator’s receipt of the NOAV, Operator shall provide the following to COGCC:

  - Operator shall perform an audit of its Mechanical Integrity Testing and MIT reporting for all its wells in Colorado. Operator shall submit a detailed report to COGCC which shows the following information for each of its wells which has been in SI or TA status for at least one month starting 24 months prior to September 25, 2018 . Operator shall email a copy of this report as an unlocked (editable) spreadsheet to the COGCC Enforcement email address indicated in the Answer section below.
    (1.) API and Well name
    (2.) SI or TA status by month, for each month the Well was SI or TA
    (3.) Date of last MIT (“n/a” if no MIT performed for that Well)
    (4.) Due date of next required MIT, according to Rules 319 and 326. If the Well is delinquent on required MIT as of NOAV issuance, indicate the due date of the most recent missed MIT.
    (5.) Date Operator has scheduled to resolve the delinquency (such as by MIT or plug and abandon), if applicable. (“n/a” if the Well is not delinquent; “none” if Well is delinquent, but Operator has not yet scheduled operations to resolve the delinquency) 
    (6.) (If TA) Whether Operator is current on the Form 4 TA Sundry submittal required by Rule 319.b.(1) & (3).

Pursuant to Rule 319.b., CITATION OIL & GAS CORP (""Operator"") is required to conduct a Mechanical Integrity Test (“MIT”) and receive Director approval prior to temporary abandonment of a well. Pursuant to Rule 326.c., Operator is required to conduct an MIT on TA wells within thirty (30) days of temporarily abandoning the well, and then at five (5) year intervals after an initial successful MIT. COGCC Rules DO NOT permit placing a well back on production to fulfill, or in lieu of, the requirements to conduct an MIT. 

COGCC Staff had reason to believe Operator had committed one or more violations of COGCC Rules, and issued Warning Letter No. 401604332 to Operator on April 11, 2018 , requiring Operator to conduct MIT or plug and abandon delinquent wells by July 31, 2018 .

On August 23, 2018 , COGCC Staff conducted an audit (“Audit”) of Operator's records for the well(s) in the attached table (""Well""). The Audit included reviewing records such as Operator's Form 7 Monthly Reports of Operations and Field Inspection Reports filed by COGCC Staff after inspecting the Well to determine the dates the Well was TA, and the COGCC database to determine whether Operator reported MIT(s) for the Well. Through this Audit, COGCC Staff determined that at least one Well in the attached table was overdue for performance of an MIT on a TA well.

Operator failed to conduct timely MIT(s) for at least one TA Well, violating Rules 319.b. and 326.c.","In its Rule 522.d.(2) Answer, due within 28 days of the Operator’s receipt of the NOAV, Operator shall provide the following to COGCC:

  - Operator shall perform an audit of its Mechanical Integrity Testing and MIT reporting for all its wells in Colorado. Operator shall submit a detailed report to COGCC which shows the following information for each of its wells which has been in SI or TA status for at least one month starting 24 months prior to August 23, 2018 . Operator shall email a copy of this report as an unlocked (editable) spreadsheet to the COGCC Enforcement email address indicated in the Answer section below.
    (1.) API and Well name
    (2.) SI or TA status by month, for each month the Well was SI or TA
    (3.) Date of last MIT (“n/a” if no MIT performed for that Well)
    (4.) Due date of next required MIT, according to Rules 319 and 326. If the Well is delinquent on required MIT as of NOAV issuance, indicate the due date of the most recent missed MIT.
    (5.) Date Operator has scheduled to resolve the delinquency (such as by MIT or plug and abandon), if applicable. (“n/a” if the Well is not delinquent; “none” if Well is delinquent, but Operator has not yet scheduled operations to resolve the delinquency) 
    (6.) (If TA) Whether Operator is current on the Form 4 TA Sundry submittal required by Rule 319.b.(1) & (3).

 - A proposed compliance plan to resolve all delinquencies identified in Operator’s audit. The proposed compliance plan will be subject to modification by the COGCC Engineering unit.

COGCC Staff had reason to believe Operator had committed one or more violations of COGCC Rule 326.b, and issued Warning Letter No. 401621370 to Operator on April 26, 2018 , requiring Operator to conduct an MIT or plug and abandon delinquent wells by July 31, 2018 .

On August 2, 2018, Operator submitted an MIT Report (Document No. 401722275, ""Form 21"") documenting a failed MIT performed on June 21, 2018, on the UPRR E MILLER TRUST 44-17 (API No. 039-06581, ""Well""). COGCC Staff had observed the unsuccessful MIT and required Operator to contact COGCC Engineering by July 12, 2018, about the Rule 319.b. requirement to abandon the Well in these circumstances (Field Inspection Report No. 688302086).

On September 25, 2018, COGCC Staff conducted an audit (“Audit”) of Operator's records for the Well. Through this Audit, COGCC Staff determined that Operator had not conducted an MIT on the Well within the required timeframes in Rules 326.b.(1) and 326.c.(1), and that Operator had not submitted any of the forms required prior to making repairs or P&A (e.g., Forms 6 or 42).

The Well failed the MIT performed on June 21, 2018, after the required timeframes, meaning Operator was required to make repairs or P&A the Well without an allowance of six months from the date of the unsuccessful test.  Three months after the unsuccessful test, Operator had neither performed repairs/P&A, nor requested COGCC approval for plans to perform such actions, violating Rule 326.f.

  - Operator shall perform an audit of its Mechanical Integrity Testing and MIT reporting for all its wells in Colorado. Operator shall submit a detailed report to COGCC which shows the following information for each of its wells which has been without hydrocarbon production for at least one month starting 24 months prior to September 25, 2018 . Operator shall email a copy of this report as an unlocked (editable) spreadsheet to the COGCC Enforcement email address indicated in the Answer section below.
    (1.) API and Well name
    (2.) SI or TA status by month, for each month the Well was SI or TA (or other status, if appropriate)
    (3.) Date of last MIT (“n/a” if no MIT performed for that Well)
          (3.a.) Pass/Fail results of last MIT.
    (4.) Due date of next required MIT, according to Rules 319 and 326. If the Well is delinquent on required MIT as of NOAV issuance, indicate the due date of the most recent missed MIT.
    (5.) Date Operator has scheduled to resolve the delinquency (such as by MIT or plug and abandon), if applicable. (“n/a” if the Well is not delinquent; “none” if Well is delinquent, but Operator has not yet scheduled operations to resolve the delinquency) 
          (5.a.) (If last MIT was Failed) Length of time (in calendar days) Well lacked mechanical integrity: starting with the date of the failed MIT (or the date of discovery of lacking mechanical integrity, if prior to the MIT); and ending with the date the well was repaired or P&A, or the date of Operator's audit if the Well still lacks mechanical integrity.
    (6.) (If TA) Whether Operator is current on the Form 4 TA Sundry submittal required by Rule 319.b.(1) & (3).

Pursuant to Rule 319.b., CAERUS PICEANCE LLC (""Operator"") is required to conduct a Mechanical Integrity Test (“MIT”) and receive Director approval prior to temporary abandonment of a well. Pursuant to Rule 326.c., Operator is required to conduct an MIT on TA wells within thirty (30) days of temporarily abandoning the well, and then at five (5) year intervals after an initial successful MIT. COGCC Rules DO NOT permit placing a well back on production to fulfill, or in lieu of, the requirements to conduct an MIT. 

COGCC Staff had reason to believe Operator had committed one or more violations of COGCC Rules, and issued Warning Letter No. 401545022 to Operator on February 14, 2018 , requiring Operator to conduct MIT or plug and abandon delinquent wells by June 30, 2018 .

On February 13, 2018 , COGCC Staff conducted an audit (“Audit”) of Operator's records for the well(s) in the attached table (""Well""). The Audit included reviewing records such as Operator's Form 7 Monthly Reports of Operations and Field Inspection Reports filed by COGCC Staff after inspecting the Well to determine the dates the Well was TA, and the COGCC database to determine whether Operator reported MIT(s) for the Well. Through this Audit, COGCC Staff determined that at least one Well in the attached table was overdue for performance of an MIT on a TA well.

Pursuant to Rule 319.b., a well may be temporarily abandoned after passing a successful mechanical integrity test upon approval of the Director, for a period not to exceed six months. A well which is incapable of production shall be abandoned within six months thereafter unless the time is extended by the Director upon application by the Operator (Rule 319.b.(3)). To maintain TA status in excess of six months, TABULA RASA ENERGY LLC (""Operator"") is required to annually submit a Sundry Notice (""Form 4-TA"") (Rule 319.b.(1)). 

COGCC Staff had reason to believe Operator had committed one or more violations of COGCC Rules, and issued Warning Letter No. 401237551 to Operator on March 20, 2017, requiring Operator to conduct MIT or plug and abandon delinquent wells and submit delinquent Form 4-TAs by April 21, 2017.

On September 25, 2018, COGCC Staff conducted an audit (“Audit”) of Operator's records for the well(s) in the attached table. The Audit included reviewing records such as Operator's Form 7 Monthly Reports of Operations and Field Inspection Reports filed by COGCC Staff after inspecting the Well to determine the dates the Well was TA, and the COGCC database to determine whether Operator had submitted required reports and notices for the Well. Through this Audit, COGCC Staff determined that the HARRY WILLIS #3 (API No. 055-06144, ""Well"") was TA at least since 2001, that Operator had begun operating the Well in 2013, and that Operator had not submitted any Form 4-TA for the Well as of September 25, 2018. 

Operator failed to timely submit Form 4-TA for a TA Well, violating Rule 319.b.","In its Rule 522.d.(2) Answer, due within 28 days of the Operator’s receipt of the NOAV, Operator shall provide the following to COGCC:

  - Operator shall perform an audit of its Mechanical Integrity Testing and MIT reporting for all its wells in Colorado. Operator shall submit a detailed report to COGCC which shows the following information for each of its wells which has been in SI or TA status for at least one month starting 24 months prior to September 13, 2018 . Operator shall email a copy of this report as an unlocked (editable) spreadsheet to the COGCC Enforcement email address indicated in the Answer section below.
    (1.) API and Well name
    (2.) SI or TA status by month, for each month the Well was SI or TA
    (3.) Date of last MIT (“n/a” if no MIT performed for that Well)
    (4.) Due date of next required MIT, according to Rules 319 and 326. If the Well is delinquent on required MIT as of NOAV issuance, indicate the due date of the most recent missed MIT.
    (5.) Date Operator has scheduled to resolve the delinquency (such as by MIT or plug and abandon), if applicable. (“n/a” if the Well is not delinquent; “none” if Well is delinquent, but Operator has not yet scheduled operations to resolve the delinquency) 
    (6.) (If TA) Whether Operator is current on the Form 4 TA Sundry submittal required by Rule 319.b.(1) & (3).

 - A proposed compliance plan to resolve all delinquencies identified in Operator’s audit. The proposed compliance plan will be subject to modification by the COGCC Engineering unit.

By the Corrective Action Due Date, Operator shall submit all delinquent Form 4 TA Sundry requests.","11/05/2018","","","","","","","","","","N","",37.556158,-105.11712,489656,4156578

On August 29, 2016, the Commission entered Administrative Order by Consent 1V-595 (“Order 1V-595”) for Dakota’s violations at the State 6-81-24-4 Well (API 05-057-06510) (“State Well”) and the Arapaho State 6-81-36-3 Well (API 05-057-06507) (“Arapaho State Well”). In Order 1V-595,  Dakota agreed to a total penalty of $172,698, of which Dakota agreed to pay $22,698 in four installments due December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017, and September 30, 2017. The Commission suspended the remaining $150,000 pending Dakota’s successful and timely completion of the following corrective actions further described in Order 1V-595: a) no later than September 30, 2016, submit to the COGCC weed control, stormwater, and interim reclamation plan prepared by a qualified expert; b) no later than September 30, 2016, either conduct a successful mechanical integrity test (“MIT”) of the State Well and submit a Form 21 evidencing the same, or plug and abandon the State Well; c) no later than October 15, 2016, install NFPA diamonds on the oil tanks at the Wells, remove unnecessary equipment from the well pads, install wildlife protection screens on production facilities at the Wells, perform maintenance on the secondary containment berm at the State Well, and provide a description of cuttings disposal at the Arapaho State Well, and submit a Form 42 evidencing completion of these corrective actions; and d) complete interim reclamation in accordance with an approved reclamation plan submitted in accordance with corrective action (a), above, within six months of plan approval. 
     
Dakota failed to timely submit a plan to address stormwater management, weeds, and interim reclamation by September 30, 2016. On February 16, 2017, Dakota submitted a plan entitled “Post-Construction Stormwater Management Plan.” On March 10, 2017, COGCC Staff informed Dakota that the Plan did not comply with the requirements of Order 1V-595 and could not be approved as submitted and requested that Dakota submit a revised plan by March 31, 2017, which Dakota failed to do.
     
COGCC records to date indicate Dakota has neither plugged and abandoned nor conducted an MIT of the State Well. On May 8, 2017 and December 20, 2017, COGCC Field Inspection Staff inspected the State Well (Field Inspection Report Nos.673404557 and 689800710) and Arapaho State Well (Field Inspection Report Nos. 673404556 and 69800708) to review Dakota’s compliance with the corrective actions required by Order 1V-595. Staff’s inspections demonstrate that Dakota has failed to complete any of the corrective actions listed in (c) and (d) above related to location maintenance and interim reclamation.
     
On December 30, 2016, Dakota attempted payment of the first penalty installment of $5,673. On January 19, 2017, this check was returned to the COGCC because of insufficient funds and on January 23, 2017, Staff informed Dakota of the returned check. Since this initial attempt, Dakota has not attempted to make a payment again. 
     
On February 9, 2017, the COGCC Director issued to Dakota a Demand Letter constituting written notice and demand for payment in full of the $172,698 penalty no later than March 11, 2017, due to Dakota’s failure to timely complete Corrective Actions (Paragraph 6, Page 6) and remit the December 31, 2016, penalty installment (Paragraph 3, Page 6) as required by Order 1V-595. COGCC Staff sent this Demand Letter to Dakota at its registered mailing address and electronic mail address on file with the COGCC. As of January 4, 2018, Dakota has failed to comply with the Demand Letter.
     
As of January 4, 2018, Dakota has failed to comply with numerous requirements of Order 1V-595, in violation of Rule 522.f. and § 34-60-121(1)(c).","Dakota must fulfill the past due requirements of Order 1V-595 by: 1) submitting payment to the COGCC in the amount of $172,698, being the entire penalty assessed under Order 1V-595, including the suspended portion, and 2) completing all outstanding corrective actions set forth in Order 1V-595.","09/30/2016","","","","","","","","","","N","",40.45005,-106.43914,377964,4478705

Pursuant to Rule 319.b., Chemco Inc (""Operator"") is required to abandon (“P&A”) within six months a TA well unless the well passes successful Mechanical Integrity Tests (“MIT”) per the frequency specified in Rule 326. Pursuant to Rule 326.c, Operator is required to conduct an MIT
on TA wells within thirty (30) days of temporarily abandoning the well, and then at five (5) year intervals after the initial successful MIT. COGCC Rules DO NOT permit placing a well back on production to fulfill, or in lieu of, the requirements to conduct an MIT. 

Pursuant to Rules 316B., 316C.f., and 326.c., Operator shall notify COGCC in writing by Field Operations Notice (“Form 42”) at least 10 days in advance of an MIT. Pursuant to Rule 316B., Operator shall report the results of any MIT on Mechanical Integrity Test (“Form 21”) within 30 days after the test. Pursuant to Rule 311., prior to P&A a well, Operator shall submit and receive COGCC approval of a Well Abandonment Report--Notice of Intent (“Form 6-N”); and within 30 days after P&A, Operator shall file the Well Abandonment Subsequent Report (“Form 6-S”) with the COGCC.

On June 30, 2017, COGCC Staff conducted an inspection of Operator’s Muir E J #1 (API No. 05-061-06084, “Well”), and wrote the following comment to Operator in the associated Field Inspection Report (No. 679902700): “Well is TA at time of inspection. Casing was dead. Tubing was dead. Passing MIT due 4/4/18.” On August 9, 2018, COGCC Staff conducted a follow-up inspection of the Well, and wrote the following comment to Operator in the associated Field Inspection Report (No. 692600071): “Well is TA at time of inspection. Extension granted on 4/4/18 to have the well plugged or successful MIT by 10/4/18.”

On November 20, 2018 , COGCC Staff conducted an audit of Operator's records for the Well, and determined that Operator had not reported performing, or intent to perform, MIT or P&A for the Well.

Operator failed to conduct timely MIT on the Well, violating Rule 326.c. Operator failed to timely P&A the Well, violating Rule 319.b.","In its Rule 522.d.(2) Answer, due within 28 days of the Operator’s receipt of the NOAV, Operator shall provide the following to COGCC:

(A.) Operator shall perform an audit of its Mechanical Integrity Testing and MIT reporting for all its wells in Colorado. Operator shall submit a detailed report to COGCC which shows the following information for each of its wells which has been without hydrocarbon production for at least one month starting 24 months prior to November 20, 2018 . Operator shall email a copy of this report as an unlocked (editable) spreadsheet to the COGCC Enforcement email address indicated in the Answer section below.

     (1.) API and Well name
     (2.) SI or TA status by month, for each month the Well was SI or TA (or other status, if appropriate)
     (3.) Date of last MIT (“n/a” if no MIT performed for that Well)
     (4.) Due date of next required MIT, according to Rules 319 and 326. If the Well is delinquent on required MIT as of NOAV issuance, indicate the due date of the most recent missed MIT.
     (5.) Date Operator has scheduled to resolve the delinquency (such as by MIT or plug and abandon), if applicable. (“n/a” if the Well is not delinquent; “none” if Well is delinquent, but Operator has not yet scheduled operations to resolve the delinquency)
     (6.) (If TA) Whether Operator is current on the Form 4 TA Sundry submittal required by Rule 319.b.(1) & (3).

(B.) A proposed compliance plan to resolve all delinquencies identified in Operator’s audit. The proposed compliance plan will be subject to modification by the COGCC Engineering unit.

All such reclamation work shall be completed within twelve (12) months on non-crop land after plugging a well or final closure of associated production facilities. All areas being reclaimed shall be kept as free as practicable of all undesirable plant species designated to be noxious weeds. Operator plugged and abandoned the North Alkali Gulch #14-22 well, API 05-067-06178, (Well) at Location #385549 on May 8, 2004 (Document #1162407). During an inspection of Location #385549 on July 17, 2012 (Document #668200030), COGCC staff observed that the location was not reclaimed and a pipeline riser and markers remained at the location. Document #668200030 required the Operator to remove the riser and obtain a Rule 502.b. variance to leave the lease road or remove and reclaim it by October 31, 2012. During an inspection of Location #385549 on September 19, 2012 (Document #668200154), COGCC staff met with Operator representatives to evaluate final reclamation requirements. Document #668200154 required Operator to remove the riser and remove the lease road or apply for a variance by December 31, 2012. During an inspection of Location #385549 on August 11, 2016 (Document #680600884), COGCC staff observed that corrective actions noted in the previous inspections have not been addressed. Approximately 2,000 spotted knapweed, 500 musk thistle, 100 leafy spurge, and 50 yellow toadflax were observed within the project area. Document #680600884 noted that the location has been out of compliance since 2005. This inspection required the Operator to reclaim the well pad, access road, and pit area and remove all oil and gas equipment. Document #680600884 also required the Operator to control weeds and stormwater erosion until the location is revegetated. Weeds were to be controlled by September 23, 2016. Final reclamation activities were required to be conducted by November 1, 2016. In September 2016, the Operator requested an extension to the Corrective Action Date to control weeds via a telephone call to COGCC staff. COGCC staff reviewed the request and approved an extension to the corrective action date to October 21, 2016. On November 4, 2016 (Document #401143540), the Operator submitted a Form 4, Sundry Notice, requesting an extension to conduct reclamation to May 31, 2017. This request was reviewed by COGCC staff and denied because the request was made four days after the corrective action date, the location has been out of compliance since 2005, and that corrective actions from inspections conducted in 2012 were not addressed. During an inspection of Location #385549 on May 25, 2017 (Document #680601637), COGCC staff observed that reclamation was not conducted on the location. Spotted knapweed, musk thistle, and leafy spurge were growing on the location. It is not apparent whether weeds were treated in fall 2016. Document #680601637 required the Operator to reclaim the well pad, access road, and pit area and remove all oil and gas equipment. This inspection also required the Operator to control weeds and stormwater erosion until the location is revegetated.

On July 24, 2018 , COGCC Staff conducted an audit (“Audit”) of Operator's records for the well(s) in the attached table (""Well""). The Audit included reviewing records such as Operator's Form 7 Monthly Reports of Operations and Field Inspection Reports filed by COGCC Staff after inspecting the Well to determine the dates the Well was SI, and the COGCC database to determine whether Operator reported MIT(s) for the Well. Through this Audit, COGCC Staff determined that at least one Well in the attached table was overdue for performance of an MIT on a SI well.

    (3.) Date of last MIT (“n/a” if no MIT performed for that Well)
    (4.) Due date of next required MIT, according to Rules 319 and 326. If the Well is delinquent on required MIT as of NOAV issuance, indicate the due date of the most recent missed MIT.
    (5.) Date Operator has scheduled to resolve the delinquency (such as by MIT or plug and abandon), if applicable. (“n/a” if the Well is not delinquent; “none” if Well is delinquent, but Operator has not yet scheduled operations to resolve the delinquency) 
    (6.) (If TA) Whether Operator is current on the Form 4 TA Sundry submittal required by Rule 319.b.(1) & (3).

On February 22, 2019, COGCC Staff inspected Operator’s Hill Ranch 25-12V (API No. 05-071-07280, “Well”) location and observed venting of natural gas: the tubing head was not installed correctly, pressure was audibly escaping from the tubing head, and a ratchet strap was being used to secure the tubing. COGCC Staff observed that no upset conditions or other 912.b. exceptional circumstances were occurring at the time of the venting, and that Operator had neither requested nor received approval from COGCC for venting/flaring at the Well location. COGCC Staff required Operator securely fasten and maintain in good mechanical condition all valves, pipes, and fittings. (Field Inspection Report No. 695100244, including Video Document No. 695100246).

As of February 28, 2019, Operator has not submitted any Form 4 request for approval to vent or flare at the Well location. 

On February 28, 2019, COGCC Staff conducted a follow up inspection of the Well and required Operator to submit daily reports for the last workover performed on the well to comply with Rule 205.g. by March 5, 2019. (Field Inspection Report No. 695100262).

Operator began venting gas from the Well, and secured a ratchet strap to the incorrectly-installed tubing, which failed to halt the venting. Operator failed to prevent or halt the venting, resulting in unnecessary and excessive venting, violating Rule 910.a. Operator failed to give notice to or seek approval from COGCC prior to such venting, violating Rule 912.b.","Operator shall immediately cease the venting and contact COGCC area engineer.

By the end of the day Tuesday, March 5, 2019, Operator shall submit an eForm 4 Sundry Notice which provides copies of the daily work reports from the time the workover rig mobilized to the location until it moved off location on or prior to February 22, 2019.","02/22/2019","","","","","","","","","","N","",37.05244,-104.84505,513777,4100701

According to Document #675201685, the Well was pressured up to 75 psi, the test failed as the Well could not hold pressure, and water returned to surface on the outside of the casing. According to the Drilling Completion Report for this Well (Document #2091771), there is not a surface casing set on the Well and a Cement Bond Log has not been run to demonstrate zonal isolation.

COGCC Rules do not permit placing a well back on production to fulfill, or in lieu of, the requirements to conduct an MIT. 

COGCC Staff had reason to believe Operator had committed one or more violations of COGCC Rules, and issued Warning Letter No. 401620976 to Operator on April 26, 2018 , requiring Operator to conduct MIT or plug and abandon delinquent wells by July 31, 2018 .

On September 25, 2018 , COGCC Staff conducted an audit (“Audit”) of Operator's records for the well(s) in the attached table (""Well""). The Audit included reviewing records such as Operator's Form 7 Monthly Reports of Operations and Field Inspection Reports filed by COGCC Staff after inspecting the Well to determine the dates the Well was SI, and the COGCC database to determine whether Operator reported MIT(s) for the Well. Through this Audit, COGCC Staff determined that at least one Well in the attached table was overdue for performance of an MIT on a SI well, and had been overdue since before February 2018.

Operator failed to conduct timely MIT(s) for at least one SI Well, violating Rule 326.b.","In its Rule 522.d.(2) Answer, due within 28 days of the Operator’s receipt of the NOAV, Operator shall provide the following to COGCC (COGCC will accept the following either directly from Operator, or from a different operator of the wells in the attached table):

  - Operator shall perform an audit of its Mechanical Integrity Testing and MIT reporting for all its wells in Colorado. Operator shall submit a detailed report to COGCC which shows the following information for each of its wells which has been in SI or TA status for at least one month starting 24 months prior to September 25, 2018 . Operator shall email a copy of this report as an unlocked (editable) spreadsheet to the COGCC Enforcement email address indicated in the Answer section below.
    (1.) API and Well name
    (2.) SI or TA status by month, for each month the Well was SI or TA
    (3.) Date of last MIT (“n/a” if no MIT performed for that Well)
    (4.) Due date of next required MIT, according to Rules 319 and 326. If the Well is delinquent on required MIT as of NOAV issuance, indicate the due date of the most recent missed MIT.
    (5.) Date Operator has scheduled to resolve the delinquency (such as by MIT or plug and abandon), if applicable. (“n/a” if the Well is not delinquent; “none” if Well is delinquent, but Operator has not yet scheduled operations to resolve the delinquency) 
    (6.) (If TA) Whether Operator is current on the Form 4 TA Sundry submittal required by Rule 319.b.(1) & (3).

 - A proposed compliance plan to resolve all delinquencies identified in Operator’s audit.

Operator is required to report each formation that is completed in a well every month from the time that it is completed until one month after abandonment.

COGCC Staff had reason to believe Operator had committed one or more violations of COGCC Rules, and issued Warning Letter No. 401620976 to Operator on April 26, 2018 , requiring Operator to resolve Operator's Form 7 inadequacies by July 31, 2018 .

On September 25, 2018 , COGCC Staff conducted an audit of Operator's records for the well(s) in the attached table (""Well""), and found persistent inadequacies in Operator’s Form 7 reporting, including inadequacies dating back prior to February 2018.

Operator failed to submit Form 7, or filed incomplete or inaccurate Form 7 information, for at least one Well for one or more months, violating Rule 309.","In its Rule 522.d.(2) Answer, due within 28 days of the Operator’s receipt of the NOAV, Operator shall provide the following to COGCC (COGCC will accept the following either directly from Operator, or from a different operator of the wells in the attached table):

COGCC Staff had reason to believe Operator had committed one or more violations of COGCC Rules, and issued Warning Letter No. 401590988 to Operator on March 29, 2018 , requiring Operator to conduct an MIT or plug and abandon delinquent wells by June 30, 2018 .

On July 26, 2018, Operator submitted an MIT Report (Document No. 2302732, ""Form 21"") documenting a failed MIT performed on July 10, 2018, on the PINNACLE UNIT #12-30 (API No. 103-05906, ""Well"").

COGCC Rules do not permit placing a well back on production to fulfill, or in lieu of, the requirements to conduct an MIT. 

COGCC Staff had reason to believe Operator had committed one or more violations of COGCC Rules, and issued Warning Letter No. 401592356 to Operator on March 30, 2018 , requiring Operator to conduct MIT or plug and abandon delinquent wells by June 30, 2018 .

On July 24, 2018 , COGCC Staff conducted an audit (“Audit”) of Operator's records for the well(s) in the attached table (""Well""). The Audit included reviewing records such as Operator's Form 7 Monthly Reports of Operations and Field Inspection Reports filed by COGCC Staff after inspecting the Well to determine the dates the Well was SI, and the COGCC database to determine whether Operator reported MIT(s) for the Well. Through this Audit, COGCC Staff determined that at least one Well in the attached table was overdue for performance of an MIT on a SI well.

Operator failed to conduct timely MIT(s) for at least one SI Well, violating Rule 326.b.","In its Rule 522.d.(2) Answer, due within 28 days of the Operator’s receipt of the NOAV, Operator shall provide the following to COGCC:

  - Operator shall perform an audit of its Mechanical Integrity Testing and MIT reporting for all its wells in Colorado. Operator shall submit a detailed report to COGCC which shows the following information for each of its wells which has been in SI or TA status for at least one month starting 24 months prior to July 24, 2018 . Operator shall email a copy of this report as an unlocked (editable) spreadsheet to the COGCC Enforcement email address indicated in the Answer section below.
    (1.) API and Well name
    (2.) SI or TA status by month, for each month the Well was SI or TA
    (3.) Date of last MIT (“n/a” if no MIT performed for that Well)
    (4.) Due date of next required MIT, according to Rules 319 and 326. If the Well is delinquent on required MIT as of NOAV issuance, indicate the due date of the most recent missed MIT.
    (5.) Date Operator has scheduled to resolve the delinquency (such as by MIT or plug and abandon), if applicable. (“n/a” if the Well is not delinquent; “none” if Well is delinquent, but Operator has not yet scheduled operations to resolve the delinquency) 
    (6.) (If TA) Whether Operator is current on the Form 4 TA Sundry submittal required by Rule 319.b.(1) & (3).

On September 20, 2019, COGCC Staff inspected the Well, and observed venting of natural gas through an open tank valve that powers the pump jack. A 3 cubic foot bag filled with gas in 4 minutes.

As of September 20, 2019, Operator had not submitted a Form 4 request to vent from the Well, and had not obtained COGCC approval for venting gas from the Well.

Without approval from COGCC, Operator vented gas from the Well during non-upset conditions, violating Rule 912.b.","Operator shall immediately cease venting and flaring at the Well location, and shall ensure it has obtained written COGCC approval via Form 4 prior to resuming venting or flaring.

On August 7, 2017, COGCC Staff conducted an inspection of the Wolf Mountain #15-2-7-87 (API No. 05-107-06222, “Well”) and observed the well pumping, that gas was being vented or flared during non-upset conditions, and that the ECD/flare was not lit (Field Inspection Report No. 689800143, “Inspection”).
      
COGCC Staff conducted an audit of Operator’s records. No Form 4 requesting approval to vent or flare was submitted until August 18, 2017, (Form 4 No. 401381184). In addition to requesting approval to vent or flare, Operator also stated in Form 4 No. 401381184 that the Well averaged 93 Mcf monthly production of natural gas. COGCC approved Operator’s Form 4 No. 401381184 vent/flare request on October 19, 2017. 
      
Operator reported monthly natural gas production of 93 Mcf each of the months of July 2015 through May 2018, with a monthly average of 86 Mcf for all reported months (August 2013 through May 2018). For every month with reported natural gas production, Operator reported identical volumes of natural gas “Used”; including reporting 93 Mcf each produced and used, consistently each month during the period encompassing the Inspection and COGCC’s approval of Form 4 No. 401381184 (July through October, 2017).

On March 3, 2017, COGCC Staff conducted an inspection of the Wolf Mountain #15-2-7-87 (API No. 05-107-06222, “Well”) Location and observed lube oils stored at the wellhead and on the pumpjack base with no secondary containment or covering. In the associated Field Inspection Report, No. 673404171, COGCC Staff instructed Operator to install or repair required BMPs per Rule 1002.f., by April 14, 2017. COGCC Staff conducted follow up inspections of the Well Location on August 7, 2017 (Field Inspection Report No. 689800143), and May 22, 2018 (Field Inspection Report No. 689800143). COGCC Staff observed that there was still no secondary containment/covering for the lube oil storage as of the August 2017 inspection, and that, while Operator had added a containment box to the pumpjack area by the May 2018 inspection, lube oils were still stored at the wellhead and on the pumpjack base outside of the containment box with inadequate or absent BMPs.

On July 24, 2018 , COGCC Staff conducted an audit (“Audit”) of Operator's records for the well(s) in the attached table (""Well""). The Audit included reviewing records such as Operator's Form 7 Monthly Reports of Operations and Field Inspection Reports filed by COGCC Staff after inspecting the Well to determine the dates the Well was SI, and the COGCC database to determine whether Operator reported MIT(s) for the Well. Through this Audit, COGCC Staff determined that at least one Well in the attached table was overdue for performance of an MIT on a SI well.

Operator failed to conduct timely MIT(s) for at least one SI Well, violating Rule 326.b.","In its Rule 522.d.(2) Answer, due within 28 days of the Operator’s receipt of the NOAV, Operator shall provide the following to COGCC:

Operator shall submit a detailed report to COGCC which shows the following information for each of its wells which has been in SI or TA status for at least one month starting 24 months prior to July 24, 2018 . Operator shall email a copy of this report as an unlocked (editable) spreadsheet to the COGCC Enforcement email address indicated in the Answer section below.
    (1.) API and Well name
    (2.) SI or TA status by month, for each month the Well was SI or TA
    (3.) Date of last MIT (“n/a” if no MIT performed for that Well)
    (4.) Due date of next required MIT, according to Rules 319 and 326. If the Well is delinquent on required MIT as of NOAV issuance, indicate the due date of the most recent missed MIT.
    (5.) Date Operator has scheduled to resolve the delinquency (such as by MIT or plug and abandon), if applicable. (“n/a” if the Well is not delinquent; “none” if Well is delinquent, but Operator has not yet scheduled operations to resolve the delinquency) 
    (6.) (If TA) Whether Operator is current on the Form 4 TA Sundry submittal required by Rule 319.b.(1) & (3).

 - A proposed compliance plan to resolve all delinquencies identified in Operator’s audit. The proposed compliance plan will be subject to modification by the COGCC Engineering unit.","11/05/2018","","","","","","","","","","N","",39.85845,-103.23909,650625,4413530

If the Well is current on MITs required by Rules 326.b. or 326.c., Operator will have six months from the date of the unsuccessful test to make repairs or P&A the well; otherwise Operator will not be given an additional six months in the event of an unsuccessful test.

Pursuant to Rule 326.b., all Shut-in (“SI”) wells shall pass an MIT: (1) within two years of the initial SI date, and (2) subsequently on 5-year intervals from the initial MIT as long as the well remains SI. According to monthly production reported by Operator (“Form 7”), the Well was continuously SI since April 2016. This means Operator was required to perform the initial MIT no later than March 31, 2018.

On March 29, 2018, Operator performed an unsuccessful MIT on the Well. (MIT Report No. 401606146, “Form 21”). This means Operator was required to repair or P&A the Well no later than September 29, 2018.

Operator submitted Form 21 on April 12, 2018. COGCC Staff processed the form the same day, and included the following Condition of Approval (“COA”): ""Failed MIT. This well must be repaired and pass a mechanical integrity test or be plugged no later than September 29, 2018."" (Form 21 No. 401606146).

On October 12, 2018, Operator requested approval to P&A the Well due to the failed MIT. (Notice of Intent to Abandon No. 401794151, “Form 6-N”). COGCC Staff approved Form 6-N on October 23, 2018.

Operator reported P&A’ing the Well, with inconsistent documentation. According to Operator’s Subsequent Report of Abandonment (No. 401868229, “Form 6-S”), Operator P&A’d the Well on November 30, 2018, or on or after December 1, 2018. Even the earliest of these reported dates is more than two months after the date by which Operator was required to have P&A’d the Well.

By unsuccessful MIT, the Well was determined to lack mechanical integrity. Operator failed to make repairs or P&A the Well until more than 8 months after the unsuccessful MIT, violating Rule 326.f.(1).","In its Rule 522.d.(2) Answer, due within 28 days of the Operator’s receipt of the NOAV, Operator shall include a compliance plan detailing an internal procedure for timely compliance with Rule 326.f.","10/28/2019","","","","","","","","","","N","",40.132992,-104.331266,556972,4442733

Operator reported that the well was producing for two days in January 2017, but COGCC Rules do not permit placing a well back on production to fulfill, or in lieu of, the requirements to conduct an MIT.","Operator missed the deadline to complete a successful MIT and must either complete a successful MIT or plug and abandon the Well as soon as possible. Rule 316B requires notice to the Director on a Form 42, Field Operations Notice at least ten (10) days prior to conducting an MIT and submission of MIT results (successful or not) on a Form 21, within thirty (30) days after the test. If an MIT is not witnessed by COGCC staff, a pressure chart must accompany this Form 21 report. If the Well lacks mechanical integrity, Rule 326.f. requires the Operator to make repairs or plug and abandon within the timeframe prescribed by Rule 326.f.1. Rule 311 requires Operator to submit a Form 6, Notice of Intent to Abandon, and secure Director approval prior to plugging and abandonment of a well and to submit a Form 6, Subsequent Report of Abandonment, within 30 days after plugging and abandonment of the well has been completed.","04/12/2017","","09/17/2018","NOAV resolved by Order 1V-674.

COGCC Rules do not permit placing a well back on production to fulfill, or in lieu of, the requirements to conduct an MIT. 

COGCC Staff had reason to believe Operator had committed one or more violations of COGCC Rules, and issued Warning Letter No. 401604432 to Operator on April 11, 2018 , requiring Operator to conduct MIT or plug and abandon delinquent wells by July 31, 2018 .

On September 13, 2018 , COGCC Staff conducted an audit (“Audit”) of Operator's records for the well(s) in the attached table (""Well""). The Audit included reviewing records such as Operator's Form 7 Monthly Reports of Operations and Field Inspection Reports filed by COGCC Staff after inspecting the Well to determine the dates the Well was SI, and the COGCC database to determine whether Operator reported MIT(s) for the Well. Through this Audit, COGCC Staff determined that at least one Well in the attached table was overdue for performance of an MIT on a SI well.

Operator failed to conduct timely MIT(s) for at least one SI Well, violating Rule 326.b.","In its Rule 522.d.(2) Answer, due within 28 days of the Operator’s receipt of the NOAV, Operator shall provide the following to COGCC:

  - Operator shall perform an audit of its Mechanical Integrity Testing and MIT reporting for all its wells in Colorado. Operator shall submit a detailed report to COGCC which shows the following information for each of its wells which has been in SI or TA status for at least one month starting 24 months prior to September 13, 2018 . Operator shall email a copy of this report as an unlocked (editable) spreadsheet to the COGCC Enforcement email address indicated in the Answer section below.
    (1.) API and Well name
    (2.) SI or TA status by month, for each month the Well was SI or TA

As of May 1, 2018, and based on the June 29, 2016, spud date Operator reported in its Drilling Completion Report (Document No. 401091715, “Form 5”), Operator was required to report the Well every month from June 2016 through March 2018.
